#This is my fist attempt at doing any programming/scripting on my own
#It's very simple and limited, but it got the job done.

#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-


#This script downloads the comics from http://romanticallyapocalyptic.com
#I used the easiest method I could find because I'm very much a n00b and I only know a little python
#It takes a couple minutes(depending on network speeds), but it's faster than doing it manually. 
#You must adjust the directory where you want the comcis to download to.
#The easiest way to do that is a search and replace for: /home/user/
#PS: The script will create two files that there aren't comics for: 1.jpg and 128.jpg 
#I don't know how to exclude those.

#You're welcome to use and distribute as you wish. I'd love it if you gave me credit. Enjoy!
